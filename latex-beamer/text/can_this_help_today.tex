\begin{frame}[fragile]{Where does this tool fit in?}

  Apply this to Upgrade/Gen2 problems?
  \vspace{1cm}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Strength: Propagation through \alert{different media with sharp boundaries}
    \item \alert{Arbitrary shapes} as long as we can calcualte the intersection points with the photon ray
    \item Interactions: \textit{Scatter}, \textit{Absorb}, \alert{plus: \textit{Detect}}
    \item Performance:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When running the same scenario, simulation \her{performance} is the \her{same as before}. \checkmark
      \item When running scenarios with \her{more scattering, simulation time increases} accordingly as expected.
      \item In comparison to other tools, \alert{compromise} of \alert{performance} and \alert{level of detail}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] Good for calibration and exploration, too slow for production
  \end{itemize}
