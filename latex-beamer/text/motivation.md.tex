\begin{frame}{Motivation and Scope}
\begin{itemize}

  \item No hole-ice simulation included in clsim, yet
    \note[item]{
      clsim approximates hole ice using a convolution function for the angular acception.
      \item e.g. photons hitting a dom from below are made more unlikely to be detected.
      \item but no actual simulation of the changed ice properties.
    }
    \begin{itemize}
      \follows No asymmetries possible, e.g. DOM position relative to hole ice
      \note[item]{i.e. we can't have asymmetries like shifted DOM positions relative to the hole ice.}
    \end{itemize}

  \item Master thesis (ending Aug 2018)
    \note[item]{that's why I'm trying to implement propagation through cylinders with changed ice properties in clsim.}
