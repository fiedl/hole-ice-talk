\begin{frame}{Outlook: Next Steps}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bring the new hole-ice simulation into IceCube's main simulation framework
    %\item Study impact of hole ice on low-energy systematics
    \item Find best hole-ice parameters (radius, scattering length) with calibration data
    \item Provide new approximation for use with high-energy studies, where a direct simulation would be too expensive
    \item Study calibration scenarios for upcoming IceCube Upgrade
  \end{itemize}
