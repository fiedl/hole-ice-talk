      \begin{itemize}
        \item Photon scattering points $A$ and $B$
        \item<1> \her{Naive algorithm}: Propagate photon small distance $\delta x$ in each simulation step and randomize whether the photon will scatter in this step (easy to implement local properties)
        \item<2> \her{Faster algorithm}: Randomize geometric distance to next scattering point and propagate from $A$ to $B$ in one simulation step
        \item<3> \her{Ice layers} with different optical properties: Randomize number of scattering lengths between $A$ and $B$ as budget and calculate geometric distance by spending the budget over the ice layers
        \item<4> \her{New:} Generalize budget algorithm to support cylinders and possibly other shapes with distinct scattering and absorption lengths and detection probabilities.
