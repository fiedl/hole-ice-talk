\begin{frame}{Outlook: What is still missing}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Re-implement ice tilt and ice anisotropy
    \item Implement direct-detection switch
    \item Merge it to icecube-simulation trunk
    \item Time frame: late 2018 / early 2019
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Next steps: Find hole-ice properties and positions by fitting calibration data.
    \item Provide ``ready to use'' GCD file with best hole-ice properties and positions.
  \end{itemize}
