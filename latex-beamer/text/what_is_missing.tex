\begin{frame}{Outlook: What is still missing}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute ice properties in hole ice rather than relative to respective bulk ice layers
    \item Separate ice properties for each cylinder
    \item Comparison to ppc results
    \item Grid scan to find best match with reference plot
    \item Study performance impact
    \item See also: \url{https://github.com/fiedl/hole-ice-study/issues}
