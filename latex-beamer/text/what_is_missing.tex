\begin{frame}{Outlook: What is still missing}

  Next steps:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Re-implement ice tilt and ice anisotropy
    \item Implement direct-detection switch
    \item Merge it to icecube-simulation trunk
    \item Time frame: late 2018 / early 2019
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip

  Follow-up ideas:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item tapered cylinders (bore holes are larger at the bottom)
    \item bent cylinders (cables)
    \item DOM oversizing for complex scenarios
  \end{itemize}

  % \bigskip
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Find hole-ice properties and positions by fitting calibration data.
  %   \item Provide ``ready to use'' GCD file with best hole-ice properties and positions.
  % \end{itemize}
